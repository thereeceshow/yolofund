# YOLO Fund

## What is it?

Ever dream of being a hedge fund manager?

It's your first day with Silverman Bags, the leading investment firm on Wall Street.

Your job is to run the YOLO Fund, and invest in a limited scope of high risk stocks to maximize returns for a group of social media millionaires.

Your future on Wall Street depends on how well you preform.

## How it works?

As a user, you will start 50 million USD to invest as the fund's manager.
Due to the funds prospectus, only certain stocks will be available to trade.

Although the money isn't real, you will be making decisions based on real market data and prices.  A huge thanks to team at **[Polygon](http://polygon.io)** for their amazing work on the API I used to get realtime stock data.
